Enter the topic to research on: what is GRPO in LLM Fine-tuning and when it's useful?
## Research Agent Execution In-progress: 
#### Research Agent Output:  Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a fine-tuning technique used in Large Language Models (LLMs) that incorporates reward functions to enhance performance on specific tasks. GRPO employs a dual-model approach, where a frozen LLM serves as a reference model to maintain baseline performance, and a trainable LLM is optimized during the training process. This method is effective for both reasoning and non-reasoning models, providing stability and preventing drastic deviations while fine-tuning.

GRPO is particularly useful in scenarios involving reinforcement learning and tasks requiring complex reasoning, such as mathematical problem-solving. The technique is versatile and can be applied to various model architectures, enhancing the model's performance across different capabilities.

### 1. Introduction to GRPO
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is an advanced fine-tuning technique employed in the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs). It leverages the power of reward functions to steer models towards achieving better performance on targeted tasks. The significance of GRPO in LLM fine-tuning lies in its ability to refine and optimize the model's capabilities, ensuring they align closely with the desired outcomes of specified tasks.

### 2. Mechanism of GRPO
The secret sauce of GRPO lies in its dual-model approach. This involves two core components:

- **The Frozen Reference Model**: This model acts as a stable anchor, maintaining the baseline performance. It's essentially a snapshot of the model's original state before any fine-tuning begins.
  
- **The Trainable LLM**: Unlike the frozen model, this one is actively modified during the training process. It undergoes optimization to improve its performance on specific tasks, guided by reward functions.

Incorporating reward functions is crucial in this setup. These functions evaluate the model's performance, providing feedback that guides the trainable LLM towards more desirable outcomes.

### 3. Benefits of GRPO
GRPO offers several compelling advantages:

- **Stability in Training**: By using a frozen reference model, GRPO ensures that the training process remains stable, preventing the model from veering off course.
  
- **Prevention of Drastic Deviations**: This approach minimizes the risk of catastrophic forgetting, where a model loses previously acquired knowledge.
  
- **Applicability to Various Models**: GRPO is versatile, proving effective for both reasoning and non-reasoning models, making it a robust solution for diverse applications.

### 4. Applications of GRPO
GRPO is particularly beneficial in scenarios such as:

- **Reinforcement Learning**: It provides a structured approach to improve models using feedback loops.
  
- **Complex Reasoning Tasks**: For tasks that require intricate reasoning, like mathematical problem-solving, GRPO fine-tuning can significantly enhance model performance.
  
- **Versatility Across Architectures**: Whether dealing with simple or complex model architectures, GRPO can be tailored to enhance performance efficiently.
