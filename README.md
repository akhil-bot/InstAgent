    C --> D[💻 Code Generator];
    D --> E[End];
```

- **Start**: The beginning of the agent creation process.
- **Team Creator**: Analyzes the task and designs the team.
- **Tool Picker**: Selects the appropriate tools for each agent.
- **Code Generator**: Generates the code for the multi-agent system.
- **End**: Completion of the agent creation process.
