## üöÄ Instant Multi-Agent Systems at Your Fingertips

**InstAgent** transforms the way you build AI agent systems. With just a text description, watch as sophisticated multi-agent networks spring to life - complete with specialized roles, intelligent tool selection, and ready-to-run Multi-Agent System.

> *"From concept to code in seconds - InstAgent bridges the gap between imagination and implementation."*

No more complex configuration, no more struggling with agent architecture. Simply describe what you want, and let InstAgent handle the rest.

## ‚ú® Why InstAgent?

- **Zero to Agent in Seconds**: Describe your needs in plain English, get a full agent system instantly
- **Expert-Level Architecture**: Creates optimized agent teams that would take experts hours to design manually
- **Seamless Tool Integration**: Automatically assigns the perfect tools to each specialized agent
- **Ready-to-Execute Code**: Generate fully functional multi-agent systems with robust workflows and connections
- **Visualization Included**: See your agent network come alive with interactive workflow diagrams
- **Enhanced Functionality with Composio**: Leverages Composio to equip AI agents with over 100 high-quality integrations, enabling seamless function calling and tool usage across various platforms.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

InstAgent employs a powerful three-stage pipeline:

1. **Team Architect** - Analyzes your task and designs the perfect team of specialized agents
2. **Tool Specialist** - Equips each agent with exactly the tools they need to excel
3. **Code Synthesizer** - Transforms your agent design into fully functional Multi-Agent System

## üìã Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akhil-bot/InstAgent.git
   cd InstAgent
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up Composio API Key**

   To use Composio's features, you'll need to set up your Composio API key. Follow the instructions provided in the <a href="https://docs.composio.dev/getting-started/quickstart" target="_blank">Composio Quickstart Guide</a> to obtain and configure your API key.

## üíª Getting Started

### Launch InstAgent

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### Create Your First Agent System in 3 Simple Steps

1. **Enter your task description** - Be as specific or general as you like or select from the examples section
2. **Click "Generate Agent"** - Watch the three-stage process unfold
3. **Use the generated code** - Download as a project or copy the Multi-Agent System implementation

### Example Usage

**Input Task:**
```
Design a research team that analyzes financial markets and generates investment recommendations.
```

**What You'll Get:**
- A specialized team of agents (Market Analyzer, Data Specialist, Investment Strategist)
- Strategic tool assignments for each agent
- Complete, ready-to-run Multi-Agent System implementation

## üìä Workflow Visualization

InstAgent provides an intuitive interface to track and visualize your agent creation process:

- **Progress Tracking**: Watch as each stage of creation completes
- **Interactive Team View**: Explore agent roles, goals, and connections
- **Tool Assignment Overview**: See which tools are assigned to which agents
- **Code Preview**: Review the generated code before downloading

    B --> C[üõ†Ô∏è Tool Picker];
    C --> D[üíª Code Generator];
    D --> E[End];
```

- **Start**: The beginning of the agent creation process.
- **Team Creator**: Analyzes the task and designs the team.
- **Tool Picker**: Selects the appropriate tools for each agent.
- **Code Generator**: Generates the code for the multi-agent system.
- **End**: Completion of the agent creation process.
